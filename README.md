## üìå About

- This application can be used to track household chores for roommates.
- A user can create a queue and invite his/her roommates.
- Users complete a queue task one by one in a loop. So, ideally, every roommate should complete a
  task on each iteration.
- The app helps to remind users about to-dos and fairly automate the tasks distribution between
  roommates based on their contribution.
- For the [REST API](https://innoqueue-dev.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html),
  the [Backend](https://github.com/InnoQueue/backend) project was developed.
